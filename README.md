# SmartCrop

Smart crop is a system that can provide Indian farmers with
predictive insights, allowing them to make better decisions
about which crops to produce considering the soil quality,
rainfall. 

Two streamlit applications have been implemented to visualise the data and the predictions made by our model. 

The following machine learning models have been implemented on the datasets: 
1. Random Forest Classifier
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Support Vector Classifier
4. Naive Bayes Classifier
5. Voting Classifier
6. Gradient Boosting Classifier
7. XGBoost Classifier
8. Neural Network

First streamlit application named main_classifiers presents the output of the basic Machine Learning models.
Second streamlit application named main_neuralnetwork presents the output of the our neural network model.
